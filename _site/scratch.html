<li>Be Passionate and Determined take responsibility (ownership) speak up We value passion, determination, perseverance, and the sense of urgency.</li>

<p>We are inspired because we believe in what we are doing and where we are going. We don&#8217;t take &#8220;no&#8221; or &#8220;that&#8217;ll never work&#8221; for an answer because if we had, then Zappos would have never started in the first place.</p>

<p>Passion and determination are contagious. We believe in having a positive and optimistic (but realistic) attitude about everything we do because we realize that this inspires others to have the same attitude.</p>

<p>There is excitement in knowing that everyone you work with has a tremendous impact on a larger dream and vision, and you can see that impact day in and day out. - Zappos Family Core Value #9</p>
